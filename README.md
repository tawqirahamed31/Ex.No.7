# Aim: To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

#AI Tools Required: 
ChatGPT (GPT-5) – for prompt-based interaction and intelligent response generation

Python – for simulating interface or integration

# Explanation: 
Prompt:
"Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time."
Procedure:
1. Define the core requirements of a personal productivity assistant.
2. Identify and construct appropriate prompts for each task using an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT).
3. Simulate natural user interaction through a simple interface or command-line system.
4. Collect feedback or inputs from users and adapt responses accordingly.
5. (Optional) Integrate basic memory to simulate preference adaptation.
EXPECTED OUTPUT: -
User Prompt 1:

“Add a reminder to submit my physics assignment tomorrow at 8 PM.”
LLM Output:
“Got it! I’ll remind you to submit your physics assignment tomorrow at 8 PM. Would you like me to add it to your daily summary?”

User Prompt 2:

“Show me all my tasks for today.”
LLM Output:
“Here’s your to-do list for today:
1️⃣ Complete English essay
2️⃣ Attend AI lab session at 2 PM
3️⃣ Call your friend about the project discussion at 6 PM.”

User Prompt 3:

“Suggest some wellness tips for today.”
LLM Output:
“Sure 😊 Here are your wellness tips for today:
🌿 Drink at least 2 liters of water.
🧘 Take a 10-minute stretch break every 2 hours.
🌤 Step outside for a short walk after lunch.”

User Prompt 4:

“What’s my free time tomorrow evening?”
LLM Output:
“You’re free between 6:30 PM and 8:00 PM. That might be a good time for relaxation or light exercise.”

User Prompt 5:

“Give me a motivational quote for studying.”
LLM Output:
“💡 ‘Success doesn’t come from what you do occasionally, it comes from what you do consistently.’ Keep pushing — every small step counts!”
Output (Example Response by LLM):
User: “Remind me to submit my project report tomorrow at 10 AM.”
Assistant: “Got it! I’ll remind you to submit your project report tomorrow morning at 10 AM.”

User: “I’ve been feeling tired lately.”
Assistant: “Maybe you’ve been overworking! Try taking a 10-minute walk or hydrate yourself—small breaks can help you recharge.”

User: “Show me all pending tasks for today.”
Assistant: “You still have two pending tasks: 1️⃣ Complete Physics notes 2️⃣ Call your mentor at 5 PM.”

Personal Productivity Assistant Features:
1. Daily Task Manager:
o Accept tasks via natural language (e.g., "Remind me to call mom at 6 PM").
o Organize tasks by priority and deadline.
o Provide daily summaries and pending items.
2. Smart Scheduler:
o Schedule events and set reminders using contextual understanding.
o Notify user of overlapping appointments or free time slots.
3. Wellness Tips Generator:
o Suggest daily wellness advice (hydration, exercise, screen-time breaks).
o Adapt suggestions based on past user preferences and responses.



# Result: 
The lab exercise resulted in the creation of a prototype concept for a personal assistant powered by large language models. Students were able to:
 Understand how to tailor LLM prompts to real-life applications.
 Foster creativity by designing features suited to their personal or academic lives.
 Learn prompt engineering techniques for optimal interaction with AI tools.
 Experience the versatility and utility of generative AI in solving everyday problems.
